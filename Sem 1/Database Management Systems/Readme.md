1. Borrower(Rollin, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status)<br>
2. Fine(Roll_no,Date,Amt)<br>
● Accept roll_no & name of book from user.<br>
● Check the number of days (from date of issue), if days are 
between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5per day.<br>
● If no. of days>30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day & for 
days less than 30, Rs. 5 per day.<br>
● After submitting the book, status will change from I to R.<br>
● If the condition of fine is true, then details will be stored 
into a fine table.</td>
